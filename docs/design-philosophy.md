## Form follows function

At its core, product design is all about getting tasks done. We are here to design solutions that enable people to accomplish a given task. Before we can envision a design we must empathize with the people who will use our products. We must recognize their frustrations, motivations, and goals. To do this we must have a comprehensive understanding of the task/problem we are trying to solve. With this foundation we can prototype, test, and iterate to get the correct user flow. Only then can we start to refine the visuals and polish the design.

## Clean, simple and easily identifiable

When keeping the primary tasks in mind, we will be able to simplify the experience. Removing any unnecessary options will reduce the cognitive load placed on users. With a clean visual style, we are able to keep the level of visual "loudness" to an appropriate level which minimizes any potential distractions and provide clarity to what's most important. Following existing design patterns or re-using existing modules from elsewhere in the application will save time by avoiding duplication of work and it provides recognizable interactions that users might already be familiar with.

## We are a team

We communicate, share ideas, and seek feedback to improve and validate our designs. This is an ongoing iterative process that always produces better results when collaborating with others. Good ideas may come from anyone so we must keep an open mind to the input we receive and not let our personal bias sway decision making. Users don't care how a solution came to be, their only interest is that the end result satisfies their goals.
